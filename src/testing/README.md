# Testing module
Given the standartized interface, all the pupil detection algorithm can be automatically tested for expected behavior. This small Python tool allows the conduction of such tests including the process of building and managing the Docker images and containers.

## Usage
The module does not depend on any external packages. Consequently, Python >= 3.7 is sufficient for running the tests.

## Utilized resources and corresponding license
The example image used for testing purposes is taken from "Labelled pupils in the wild: A dataset for studying pupil detection in unconstrained environments (Inproceeding) Proc. of the 9th ACM International Symposium on Eye Tracking Research & Applications (ETRA 2016), pp. 139-142, 2016" by Marc Tonsen, Xucong Zhang, Yusuke Sugano, and Andreas Bulling.

# Testing module
Given the standartized interface, all the pupil detection algorithm can be automatically tested for expected behavior. This small Python tool allows the conduction of such tests including the process of building and managing the Docker images and containers.

## Usage
The module does not depend on any external packages. Consequently, Python >= 3.7 is sufficient for running the tests.

## Utilized resources and corresponding license
The example image used for testing purposes is taken from "Robust real-time pupil tracking in highly off-axis images" by Lech Åšwirski,Andreas Bulling, and Neil A. Dodgson (https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/rainbow/projects/pupiltracking/datasets/).

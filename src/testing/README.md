# Testing module
Given the standartized interface, all the pupil detection algorithm can be automatically tested for expected behavior. This small Python tool allows the conduction of such tests including the process of building and managing the Docker images and containers.

## Usage
The module does not depend on any external packages. Consequently, Python >= 3.7 is sufficient for running the tests.

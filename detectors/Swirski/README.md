This folder contains the pupil detector proposed in [Robust real-time pupil tracking in highly off-axis images](https://doi.org/10.1145/2168556.2168585) by L. Świrski, A. Bulling, and N. Dodgson. The code and the algorithm are licensed under MIT license and are based upon the implementation in [Open-PupilEXT](https://github.com/openPupil/Open-PupilEXT).
